cloud functions:

serverless execution envirnonment for building and connecting cloud services.
by CF we write simple functions that are attached to events emitted from other services like cloud storage,bigquery,pub/sub.
we can write functions in various lang like java,python,node js,go etc.
offered in 2 versions-1st gen and 2nd gen.
we can automate so many task using cloud functions 
1.data processing/ETL ---respond to GCS file events, pubsub messages(data published to pubsub topic).
we can write a logic/code in rsponse to data processing in storage buckets,data published to pubsub topic
2.webhooks - respond to HTTP triggers,third party apps like github,slack... etc

finally after deploying ur function



API:
application programming interface,makes software development process easy by permitting seamless and secure dtaa transfer between two apps

	examples:login with using facebook
	while using some websites , we see login with using facebook account it means that website uses the facebook api to integrate its services and skip sing up process


apchi beam - 
is a set of open source SDK's,that developers use to interact with the data flow models. 

Apache Beam is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines.
Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the pipeline.
The pipeline is then executed by one of Beamâ€™s supported distributed processing back-ends, which include Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.



allows folks to compose highly expressive batch and streaming pipelines with the lang of their choices and to run those pipleines on a number of diff runners.

suppoerted langs include java,python,SQL,go and we can also choose runners,where ur pipelines will actually be executed.
